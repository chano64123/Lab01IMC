    <string name="recomendacion3_4_1">People who are overweight or obese are at higher risk for chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.</string>
    <string name="recomendacion3_4_2">Anyone who is overweight should try to avoid gaining more weight. Also, if you are overweight along with other risk factors (such as high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or high blood pressure), you should try to lose weight. Even a small decrease (as little as 10% of your current weight) can help lower your risk of disease. Talk with your healthcare provider to establish proper ways to lose weight.</string>
